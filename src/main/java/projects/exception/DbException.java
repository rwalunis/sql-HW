/**
 * This exception class is used throughout the DIY projects application. It is an unchecked
 * exception.
 * 
 * Note the use of @SupressWarnings("serial"). This is used because the Java compiler generates a
 * warning if the instance variable serialVersionUID is missing. The variable serialVersionUID is
 * used by the Serialization process to specify a version number that is used in Serialization.
 * Serialization is the process of sending a class and its data to a remote process, likely on
 * another server. The warning is generated because the parent class, RuntimeException, declares the
 * serialVersionUID variable. Since we are not interested in Serialization, this can be safely
 * ignored. By adding @SuppressWarnings("serial"), the warning is turned off.
